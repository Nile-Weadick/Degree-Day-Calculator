# Degree-Day-Calculator
Program to compute the electrical Degree Days for a particular day given the high and low temperature for the day.
Degree days are based on the assumption that when the outside temperature is 65°F, we don't need heating or cooling to be comfortable. Degree days are the difference between the daily temperature mean, (high temperature plus low temperature divided by two) and 65°F. The most common use of degree days is for tracking energy use. Without degree days, comparing the energy used over two periods would be difficult. Energy companies often maintain degree day data from year to year to estimate reasonable variations in usage. This involves calculating the Degree Days for each day of the billing period and comparing the total to the previous years total. If the total degree days for this billing month is say 20% higher than last year, one could reasonably expect electric usage to jump by 20% compared to last year. Some variations include calculating separate heating and cooling requirements. Generally, the electric company does not care if you are heating or cooling because the fans still run and consume electricity. Gas companies on the other hand might only care about heating degree days because you do not use gas to cool your home.
